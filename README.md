‚ú® Features

    Blazing Fast GPU Acceleration: Leverages the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for PySpark to crush data processing tasks on the GPU.

    Massive Data Crunching: Effortlessly processes the entire r/place dataset of over 132 million pixel updates.

    Stunning Timelapse Generation: Produces a high-quality, dynamic video of the canvas's evolution from the first pixel to the last.

    Scalable by Design: Built on Apache Spark, ready to scale from a single workstation to a full-blown cluster.

üöÄ Performance

Processing 132 million records is no small feat. Traditional CPU-based processing can be a bottleneck. This is where NVIDIA RAPIDS comes in.

    By offloading heavy-duty operations like filtering, sorting, and aggregations to the GPU, we achieve a massive performance boost. This makes it feasible to analyze the entire dataset and render the final video in a fraction of the time it would take on a CPU.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.
üì¶ Prerequisites

    Anaconda or Miniconda: The recommended package manager.

    Apache Spark: The core distributed computing engine.

    NVIDIA GPU: A CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU is required.

    NVIDIA RAPIDS: The magic behind the GPU acceleration.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: RAPIDS is officially supported on Linux only.

    Jupyter: For an interactive experience with the notebook.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

    Clone the Fortress: Get the code on your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/para7ite/rplace_spark_cuda.git
    cd rplace_spark_cuda

    Set Up Your Environment: Create a dedicated conda environment.

    conda create -n rapids-24.12 python=3.10
    conda activate rapids-24.12

    Install the Power (RAPIDS):

    # This command installs RAPIDS and its dependencies
    conda install -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia rapids=24.12 python=3.10 cudatoolkit=11.8

    Install Other Tools:

    pip install pyspark matplotlib cupy

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

    Launch Jupyter:

    jupyter notebook

    Open rplace_gpu.ipynb and run the cells from top to bottom.

    Witness the Creation: The script will download the data, process it, and save the final timelapse as animated_canvas.mp4 in the project directory.
